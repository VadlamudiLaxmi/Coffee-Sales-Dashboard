# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data to gain insights into customer behavior and sales trends. The dataset includes information on customers, orders, and products.I have analysed the data and drawn the insights. 

## Process
* Firstly, I have gone through the entire data, found some duplicates and null values.
* So, I have cleaned the data by removing the duplicates, replaced the null values with the appropriate values and formatted the numerical columns to overcome the abnormality in the data.
* After making the data accurate for analysis, I took out the basic insights of the dataset with the help of _Descriptive Statistical analysis_ such as Total sales, Coffee Type Name, Loyalty card etc,.
* The next step was to analyze the data by taking a deep dive into it with the help of Pivot Table. I created numerous tables to fetch all the important insights such as _Total sales over time, top 5 customers, sales by country_ etc.
* I have created 3 _slicers_ for Roast Type Name, Loyalty card and Size.
* Finally, I have created a _dynamic dashboard_ with all the useful insights.
